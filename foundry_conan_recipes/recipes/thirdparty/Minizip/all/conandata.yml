# From the minizip source page (the original writers website)
# http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html It mentions that minizip is now
# part of zlib under contrib/minizip.  Looking at the Changes it mentions it is
# still version 1.1, so we retain that version number; rather than using zlibs.
