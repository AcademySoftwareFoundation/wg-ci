# Meetings 

Meetings are scheduled monthly on Wednesday at 13:00 US Pacific Time (offset from the biweekly cadence of the TAC meetings) and are open to anyone interested in participating in the Continuous Integration Working Group. You can follow the CI WG discussions by joining the #wc-ci channel on the [ASWF Slack Workspace](https://slack.aswf.io/).

You can review past meeting notes below and the [calendar of meetings](https://lists.aswf.io/calendar).

For the next CI WG meeting, you can propose agenda items either [via posting to the #wg-ci Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/TKA297NS0/C0169RX7MMK), or as a pull request against [these meeting notes](/meetings).

There is a [template](template.md) file in here for creating the upcoming meeting agenda. Note that there is a required metadata section at the top that must be present in order the meeting notes to show in the right place when viewed through the Netlify presentation of this repository.
