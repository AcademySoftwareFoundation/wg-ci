## New items

* Kerby: does CI WG have resources to help with CI for OpenRV?
    * JF: nothing explicit, but could set up a 1h collaboration
    * Larry: do we ever help explicitly? We set up the examples, projects run with it.
    * Andrew: yes, typically projects look at what other projects have done. Releng can help, but the projects are the subject matter experts. Releng can help make sure it's well designed and the infrastructure is available.
    * Larry: generally projects are very helpful, so if you asked the OpenEXR what they set up (for instance), projects will be happy to help. Identifying projects solving similar problems are happy to help.
    * Kerby: it was asked how long it would take, for Linux it's pretty much covered. Mac/Windows might take more time. Larry: most projects start with one platform, don't feel you need to solve everything in a single PR. Kerby: we typically build it with internal CI at Autodesk, so we're not starting from scratch.
    * Christina: would be happy to help if OpenEXR is an example to follow.
    * Larry: if you already have build scripts (bash for instance) to get the dependencies, build the software, you should start with that, later on you can move on to use the scaffolding to run multiple builds on GHA.
* Open Source Days and SIGGRAPH feedback
    * Epic Games contracted Windows port for xStudio. Does it make sense to try to fund someone external to do aswf-docker containers on Windows
        * Kerby: Windows Containers is way less straightforward than Linux, so it could be useful? Using GHA with Windows, we have a lot of ways to get what we want easy. So the containers may not be needed, build directly on the Windows runners.
        * JC: having Docker images that people can use to build their software in a VFX Platform compliant would be useful for people building applications. And you get a fixed environment / replicable builds. You can pin a hash to a specific version, unless you 'yum update' inside a container.
        * JC: Microsoft is a premiere member of ASWF, should we ask them if we hit road blocks?
    * Lots of interest in binary distributions (also on Slack)
    * VFX Reference Platform BoF: majority of larger studios moving to Rocky / Alma / RHEL 9, skipping 8. Larry: what's the upshot of building on 8 instead of 9? Why not directly on 9? JF: that's called out by the libc version. Mike: studios that have started transition to 8 would then have to transition again to 9. Glibc in RHEL 9 is 2.34, for people on Ubuntu, even Ubuntu 22.04 is on a different version, decision was made when Ubuntu 20.04 was current, which had older glibc. So giving a path forward given the compatibility between 8 and 9. In 9 you will have to install the compat- versions of older packages. So provide the widest range of compatibility, and focus dev resources on a single platform.
    * Larry: in Wenzel's keynote, he repeated a recommendation that people look hard at using Jupyter notebooks in interesting ways, I've not done that before, but now it's on my list. Singing the praise of how easy it is to experiment in that environment. JF: Aloys had a PR to add Jupyter to aswf-docker? Aloys: might be trying to do too much at the time, trying to render in USD, needed OpenGL, trying to bite off too much at once. It got close, but didn't happy. The Jupyter part was pretty easy. Can take the ci-vfxall image and add the Jupyter extra Python package. Use the Jupyter package from Google, get USD, OpenEXR... JC: our projects are getting closer and closer to being on PyPI, OCIO is there, once you have stuff on PyPI, it's really easy to import them in Jupyter notebooks. Only missing project is OIIO for now, which is a bigger beast.

        * UBI image missing specific GCC toolset to be used as a base
        * Probably no need for additional 2023 images
        * Aloys: JF to create PyPI account, and can be added as maintainer for aswfdocker PyPI project
* Support additional CI systems (Travis, Circle, Cirrus) to gain access to ARM, GPU runners?
    * [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
    * [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/pricing/)
    * [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/linux/)
        * Tart: manage Linux and macOS VMs on Apple Silicon: [https://tart.run/](https://tart.run/)
    * Any ASWF projects using another CI than GHA? JC: only OCIO with GPU on AWS CodeSpaces, but triggered through GHA. Technically a separate CI system, OCIO has to define a CodeBuild workflow.
    * Larry: I used to use some of the others, when GHA came along I switched. When I looked back, I looked at whether one had a ARM base platform, Travis mostly removed their free tier, only exists as a paid service. So hard to add to open source projects without paying for it. Once I moved to GHA, I mostly stopped looking at other services. Once we had the containers stood up, that was very convenient.
* Candidate VFX centric libraries for inclusion in vfx-all?
    * To discuss on Slack
    * For instance: [https://www.openimagedenoise.org/](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/)
    * Should there be a build of OpenCV? Larry: we don't necessarily use it, provides helper functions to move data, but we may not care enough. It's a big elephant to swallow, but may not be worth it for a couple of functions that not everyone uses. But if other projects needed it, I would use it.
    * Larry: Libraw would be nice, and could be used by raw2aces, ORIO might use it. Studios depend on that. JF: there may be a Foundry Conan recipe for libraw. Larry: for OIIO I use the containers and some without, so I test against libraw for non container build. JC: do you build from source, or apt install? Larry: one piece of the test matrix is to build against top of tree for important dependencies, and libraw is one of those. OIIO has a build_libraw build script, so we test against their top of tree. LIbraw can make non backwards compatible changes at non obvious releases. [OIIO build_libraw script](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/src/build-scripts/build_libraw.bash)
    * Jupyter notebooks [existing PR needs to be updated](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker/pull/68)
* No aswf-docker swag in the ASWF swag store
    * We need a logo!
    * Larry: a logo is a major ordeal for every project
* Mike: for the GPU runners, any progress on figuring out the CUDA drivers? In place update? Larry: can try in OSL, had some work in progress, had it half done, can update the branch and push to the main branch to check. Same runner names? Andrew: haven't changed them. JF: can run nvidia-smi just to check. f Mike: still using the 470 drivers? JF: last time I checked / had access. Mike: not 100% you will be able to update? JF: think you have access to the VM before the container starts, so should be possible to update. Mike: also whether or not the vendor specific GRID driver is being used. JF: should be possible to pull the pre-licensed GRID driver from Azure bucket. Mike: lack of availability of GRID driver versions can be an issue on prem as well.

## Follow Ups

* GitHub Updates (Andrew)
    * Lost access to beta GPU runners?
        * Runners are supposed to be Azure NCv3 instances with V100 GPUs: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series)
        * Should support both latest CUDA as well as OpenGL / Vulkan
        * Unclear what NVIDIA driver they will be running, may be possible to upgrade as part of GHA if we want to support CUDA 12 for VFX Platform 2024 (Mike Rochefort):
            * Unloading the kmods
            * Running the installer (or upgrading the RPM/DEB)
            * Loading the newly built kmods
        * Andrew: I'm seeing all the GPU runners. JF: I have a releng ticket, IT-25805. Andrew: will follow up.
    * Updates on Apple Silicon runners beta?
        * Andrew: had meeting today, our normal folks from GitHub were on vacation, so the people on the meeting were not the normal people we walk to. Entire discussion was about the Project Board feature.
* PyPI organization level account still in private beta?
    * Andrew: no other LF foundations have gotten this yet
    * JC: are there requests for subprojects? Andrew: RelEng team only touches 13 projects of the 300+ LF major projects, so there's no standard process. But of the projects that we are involved in, no one has managed to get this to work. JC: maybe LF is a bit too big for PyPI, they may not want so many requests at once. Andrew: I think the process is manual. JC: yes, I think it is.
* Create a RSS channel in ASWF Slack (JF TODO, not done yet)
    * Still TODO
* Commercial DCC integration
    * Move Houdini download project somewhere else? [https://github.com/tykeal/sidefx-web-cli](https://github.com/tykeal/sidefx-web-cli)
        * Remains TODO
    * Would OpenFX want a Nuke / Resolve / Natron download for its projects?
        * JF to reach out to OpenFX (remains TODO)
* Need to produce some kind of deliverable from our CII badging discussions
