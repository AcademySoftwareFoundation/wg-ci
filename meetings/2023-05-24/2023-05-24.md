## New items

* CI WG report to TAC (short) post mortem:
    * [CI Working Group Status Report to ASWF TAC May 2023](./ASWF-TAC-2023-CI-WG-Report.pdf)
    * [https://tac.aswf.io/meetings/2023-05-17/2023-05-17.html](https://tac.aswf.io/meetings/2023-05-17/2023-05-17.html)
    * Andrew: ASWF is uncommon where LF releng provides repo admin access. Was at Open Source Summit North America, saw a presentation from folks at Eclipse foundation, developed as system for managing organizations and repos at the repo level, so could handle permissions requests as PR (for repo level requests). We are looking at rolling this out, won't remove existing rights, but will try to reduce the attack surface. Will configure itself based on current permissions, keeps tracks on repo settings, any settings accessible via API and UI. Can have it set to manage global permissions and individual repositories. Looking at now. All done through a repository so can be tracked, called AutoDog, private repo within the organization it is managing. For UI only settings, using some kind of headless browser system in Python (playright) so can sometimes be a bit brittle. They have issues open with GitHub to move these functions into APIs, LF will also agitate to move these settings into APIs.
* VFX Platform 2024 Draft
    * [https://vfxplatform.com/](https://vfxplatform.com/)
        * Python 3.11
        * Qt 6.5
            * Kerby: a big transition for OpenRV. We parse the Qt documentation to generate our own bindings, MuQt, so will be interesting / non trivial project. Will need to re-learn how this works.
* Progress on VFX Platform Docker containers
    * Draft PR: [aswf-docker pr#166](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker/pull/166)
    * OpenGL / glvnd layer on top of NVIDIA cuda containers working: captured by script [https://github.com/jfpanisset/aswf-docker/blob/jf_rocky8_01/scripts/common/install_opengl.sh](https://github.com/jfpanisset/aswf-docker/blob/jf_rocky8_01/scripts/common/install_opengl.sh)
        * Thoughts on how to give proper attribution to NVIDIA? License file in base container sufficient?
        * Andrew: using base image provided by NVIDIA, and using scripts they open source, should not need to get explicit guidance? May want to add specific SHA on which the script is based, can use this to find any future changes. I always like to point to explicit commit I reference when doing things like that.
        * Larry: is Optix on your radar? Andrew: in monthly meeting with GitHub today, brought up our laundry list of requests, "would you like us to do a meeting with ASWF"? Yes, we would like that. Will work with our community reps to have a ASWF / GitHub meeting, will be able to get direct answers. Larry: this would be cool. As for Optix, don't remember if this is something about our base image or the GitHub runner. JF: yes, def on the todo list, for a "2023.1" release.
        * Larry: I do tests against Intel compilers in my projects, Intel has a repo you can do a yum install from, but it's unreliable, on any given day, that server may or may not be working, or it may die. And sometimes they will replace versions, which breaks CI. Would be nice to be able to lock components in a container that we can reliably pull from? Whatever Intel is doing is not that reliable.
        * Andrew: we have to be careful in mirroring to Artifactory, can be legal implications, so usually LF stance is "we don't mirror" unless we get specific permission. We would have to evaluate the licensing of the repository. Even if we did, if we mirror properly, we would also be deleting versions as Intel removes them. Larry: wasn't necessarily thinking we would mirror, but have a version of ASWF docker containers with Intel compilers installed? They provide the compilers for that reason. Just installing those packages on our base images, like we have a LLVM base image. Andrew: yes, we should be able to do this.
        * Larry: they have web pages documenting how to install the compilers. JC: have to be careful not to redistribute their compilers? Andrew: then we can't mirror or add to our containers since that would be a redistribution.
        * JF: will reach out to Intel TAC rep for permission, consider inclusion. JC: could be a size consideration?
    * Remaining issue with Conan confusion with setting the VFX platform "year", currently breaks non-2023 builds
    * Hoping to start on 2024 draft as soon as 2023 is up and running
* Aswf-docker containers for new/missing ASWF projects
    * OpenFX
    * OpenImageIO - Larry
    * OpenRV / xStudio - Kerby: just Linux is not enough. Kerby: we want to build in an efficient way. Current builds everything it needs, so we can look at the Windows container for now. JF: can use the aswf-baseqt containers. Larry: main benefit to the project is that if you are spending a lot of time on the CI run for builds that never change, want to cache that. Kerby: caching is fine on Linux, but not easy on Windows. If we have to cache dependencies, we'll do something with Artifactory, since that has to work on Mac and Windows. JC: can also use GitHub cache. It's a fast local cache. Kerby: Autodesk has a great internal setup for multi platform builds, but thats' not something we can use.
    * OpenAssetIO
    * Rez: just Python, don't use the containers, but did use them for Windows, rez has a PowerShell core plugin which takes a long time to download and install on Windows, same for Chocolatey, so we create our own Windows containers for tests. Starting to reconsider, but they are hard to maintain. Pulling them from GitHub Docker repo, so no throttling.
    * Raw2aces
    * Volunteers to reach out to these projects to gather dependency requirements / CI build scripts?
* Foundry contribution of Conan build scripts
    * Apache licensed
    * Where best to host for now?
        * JC: can we publish them? JF: yes, under Apache license
        * JC: we could put them in WG repo for now while we figure out what to do with them? They could move to their own repo. Christina: yes, seems that they would belong in the wg-ci repo.
        * JF: sounds like a plan, will do it.
        * JC: will  be interesting to look at the variants for the packages, see how they make the variants.
* OpenFX RFC on CI: [https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openfx/pull/119](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openfx/pull/119)
* JC custom GHA bot: [https://github.com/JeanChristopheMorinPerso/rez-pip](https://github.com/JeanChristopheMorinPerso/rez-pip)
    * More an experiment than anything: rewriting Rez as a pip integration, so you can take a wheel from PyPI and convert to a Rez package. Moving it to its own plugin, before had to provide pip, find the way to put pip in a rez package, which can be messy. Now bundling pip, not the source code, but the zipapp (provided by pip), not massively used, just download it, run python and can run it without install. Bundled in the repo, not a big zip file. On a weekly basis, the bot checks the current bundled version, checks the current version, downloads it updates, check if the update broke any of the tests, if it all works, merge the pull request. Homemade version of dependabot for custom dependencies that dependabot doesn't know about.
    * Understands semantic versioning, use the Python package "packaging", understands version comparison, can pin versions, or implement custom logic.
    * JF: could be use for automatic updates to aswf-docker containers. JC: the bot is just a GitHub Actions workflow.
* Commercial DCC integration
    * Move Houdini download project somewhere else? [https://github.com/tykeal/sidefx-web-cli](https://github.com/tykeal/sidefx-web-cli)
    * Would OpenFX want a Nuke download for its projects?
* Candidate VFX centric libraries for inclusion in vfx-all?
    * For instance: [Intel OpenImageDenoise](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/)
