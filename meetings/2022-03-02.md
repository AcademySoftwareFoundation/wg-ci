* Revised CI WG Mission Statement
    * [Proposed Revision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTP3aRRIP-KNeq0ZomD18y89iZnntI8Nsg9Hav4APg8/edit)
    * Haven't had opportunity to present to TAC yet due to focus on Open Source Days
* Open Source Days
    * Was going to present slides, but haven't had time to do them yet, will try this afternoon and share on Slack
    * Was going to concentrate on ASWF Docker and GPU builds as concrete deliverables, any other major points?
        * Forum for discussing topics between companies and projects?
        * Not more than 5 slides, possibly only 2 (exec level audience)
    * Anyone want to present? Supposed to be 5 min only
        * JF can present, will post exact time to Slack channel
* DCC Open Source Usage Spreadsheet from Jeff Bradley
    * [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWExH2VMsXpb7XTDDKkQbl9Lpei9-zES-qml9lel0ME/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWExH2VMsXpb7XTDDKkQbl9Lpei9-zES-qml9lel0ME/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Any updates?
    * What would a machine consumable version of this look like
    * Brent: should there be a web presentation like the Python 3 VFX
* Rez accepted as incubation stage ASWF project
    * Slack discussions on GitHub Actions for SPDX enforcement, should we document / prototype this?
    * Release process standardization / automatic Changelog Generation (some tools previously discussed here)
    * Do all ASWF projects use Semantic Versioning?
    * Andrew: was looking at tags on issues and PRs, looking at semantic commits instead. Using third party GitHUb Action, "release-drafter":
        * [GitHub - release-drafter/release-drafter: Drafts your next release notes as pull requests are merged into master.](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
        * Considering transitioning to [GitHub - semantic-release/semantic-release: Fully automated version management and package publishing](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
    * Release process standardization
        * Larry: cautious about having individual projects bending their "routine" that works for them. Don't want to add a burden.
        * Andrew: standardized release of source or binaries? Larry: most projects don't release binaries (yet). Andrew: release-drafter and semantic-release will help with that.
        * Larry: can mess with the way projects handle their release notes, trigger their releases.
        * Andrew: also have a hand built release job?
        * [tykeal/homeassistant-rental-control](https://github.com/tykeal/homeassistant-rental-control/blob/main/github/workflows/release.yaml)
        * When you click "release" in the UI, it triggers this job
        * Current workflow: when changes get merged into project, release-draft gets drafted to pull in current draft of the release notes. It looks for a tag, does a patch level version bump (understands semantic versions). Looks for a tag in GitHub for that release.
        * In the end, just builds a zip file and bumps the version. There's a file that specifies the version number, in source code it's 0.0.1, every time you release, the version tag is larger than that. So it updates that file and builds the zip file (the update to the version file is not checked in, so the zip file contains one file that's not in the repo).
* ASWF Docker Updates
    * No updates
    * Some outstanding things that need to be done, OpenEXR 3.1.4
* Dependabot for ASWF Projects for non-VFX Platform dependencies?
    * [https://github.com/dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)
    * Used by the TAC repo for some automations (needs someone to take a look at it to update the GitHub Actions)
    * Larry: since most projects are C++, may not be relevant (finding dependencies at built time). Tend to not be prescriptive about which dependency versions. More applicable for internal dependency you can lock down on specific version. But could be nice to have alerts, the containers have versions that are outside our projects, so could be nice to get some automated alert when new things come out on those dependencies. Or problems identified with the versions we are using or recommending, have a way to bring that to our attention.
    * Andrew: [https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/a0941000](https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/a0941000)
    * Could it post to a slack channel?

## Tools

* Sonarcloud posting updates to GitHub
    * **[https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarcloud-integrates-with-github-security/58283](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarcloud-integrates-with-github-security/58283)**
* Mermaid diagram tools in GitHub
    * [https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/)
    * Andrew: came up on touch base with GitHub: the way it operates, if you are in a browser with Javascript enabled, it inserts an iframe, otherwise it renders the text. Likely to become a Markdown standard, GitHub-flavored Markdown is becoming standardized. Larry: didn't realize there was a formal Markdown standardization process. That's great.
    * Larry: [standardmarkdown.com](http://standardmarkdown.com/) , not sure if that's the right one.
* Sandboxie as an alternative to Docker on Windows?
    * [https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie)
* Reproducible Builds effort
    * [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

## Follow Ups

* Updates on GHA custom / for pay instances
    * Should be available for beta testing (without GPU) at end of March
    * What about ARM machines? No ETA. Should we look at Oracle Cloud? [ServeTheHome Oracle Cloud Ampere Arm Free Instances](https://www.servethehome.com/oracle-cloud-giving-away-ampere-arm-a1-instances-always-free/)
    * Any flavor of Linux on non-GPU hardware (slow rollout). If Azure has ARM, should be available eventually. No update on M1, Azure having issues getting enough M1 systems.
    * Andrew: custom / for pay runners: beta starting end of March, no GPU builders yet, just bigger size Linux instances. GPU instances are scheduled for next month or month after that, along with Windows instances. Also asked about M1 builders, they haven't been able to get enough devices.
* Updates on LF code signing infrastructure
